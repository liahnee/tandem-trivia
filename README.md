## The Code Challenge
The goal of the code challenge was to create any type of a trivia app.

Assumptions
* A round of trivia has 10 Questions
* All questions are multiple-choice questions
* Your score does not need to update in real time
* Results can update on form submit, button click, or any interaction you choose
* We will provide you with the trivia data such as the questions, correct and incorrect answers via a JSON file.

Acceptance Criteria
* A user can view questions.
* Questions with their multiple choice options must be displayed one at a time. Questions should not repeat in a round.
* A user can select only 1 answer out of the 4 possible answers.
* The correct answer must be revealed after a user has submitted their answer A user can see the score they received at the end of the round

## Codes
### Components and Containers   
The app has three components mix matched in App.js or review.js. App is either rendering the start button, the three components, or the review container, which hold the same two of the three components in different format. 
### Test
UI component tests are written with react testing library and jest that comes with create-react-app(CRA). Each of the component -question, answer, and score- test checks whether the component renders DOM correctly with given props. The App and review tests mostly checks on whether the functionalities, such as clicking on a button, will render the changed components correctly. As the app is very dynamic with random questions, test mostly finds the element through element id rather than its text.
### Routes    
The app has three different views: start page, question page, and review page. The review page was the only container component used. Because the current useStates already had enough data to determine which components to render, I decided to place the components into a function rather than adding routes. I normally use react-router-dom for apps with more components and pages.
### State  
The App container mostly hold only one level of children for questions and answers and one two-levels depth with a review container. The App container manages all the states using useState hook. Since I am more comfortable using Redux with React, if I was to add more components and functions, I would move from using only useState to Redux.
